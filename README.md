Implementing a Simple Shell
Now that you have a good understanding of what a shell is and how it works, let's discuss the high-level steps involved in implementing a simple custom shell. Remember, this is a broad overview, and each step can be quite involved:
Command Line Input: Your shell should read and parse user input. This involves handling commands, arguments, and any special operators (e.g., >, <, |).
Command Execution: Once a command is parsed, your shell needs to execute it. This involves creating processes, loading executable files, and managing their execution.
Built-In Commands: Implement built-in commands like cd to change directories, echo for displaying text, and exit to exit the shell. These commands don't require creating separate processes.
Environment Variables: Support setting, modifying, and accessing environment variables within your shell.
I/O Redirection: Implement input and output redirection, allowing users to redirect standard input and output streams to and from files.
Pipelines: Enable the chaining of commands using pipes (|) to pass the output of one command as input to another.
Error Handling: Handle errors gracefully. If a command fails, provide appropriate error messages.
Scripting: Implement the ability to run shell scripts containing a sequence of commands saved in a file.
Customization: Allow users to customize their shell environment by modifying configuration files like ~/.bashrc.
Prompt: Display a user-friendly prompt to indicate that the shell is ready to accept input.
Signal Handling: Handle signals like Ctrl+C (interrupt) and Ctrl+Z (suspend) to ensure the shell behaves as expected.
Cleanup: Ensure proper termination of processes and cleanup of resources when the shell exits.
Building a complete shell is a complex task, and it's usually done incrementally, starting with basic features and gradually adding more advanced capabilities. You can begin by implementing a very basic shell that can execute simple commands and then gradually expand its functionality.
To create your own shell, you'll need to delve into systems programming, process management, and parsing techniques. It's a challenging but rewarding project that will deepen your understanding of both programming and operating systems.

Let's break down the project into smaller tasks and create a flowchart to guide you through the implementation process. Here are the main steps involved in creating a simple shell:
Breakdown of the project into smaller tasks to guide us through the implementation process. Here are the main steps involved in creating a simple shell:
1. Displaying a prompt: Write a function to display a prompt (e.g., "$") to indicate that the shell is ready to accept commands.


2. Reading user input: Implement a function to read input from the user. You can use getline() to read the input line by line.


3.Parsing the user input: Create a function to parse the user input into individual commands and arguments. You can use strtok() to split the input into tokens.


 4. Handling built-in commands: Identify built-in commands like "cd" “exit” without arguments and implement separate functions to handle them. For example, when the user enters "cd directory", you should change the current working directory to "directory".


5. Executing external commands: Implement a function to execute external commands using the execve() system call. You will need to fork a child process and replace it with the desired command using execve(). The parent process should wait for the child process to complete.


6. Handle the PATH fork must not be called if the command doesn’t exist


7. Handle Implementation of the env built-in, that prints the current environment


8. Handling signals: Set up signal handlers to handle signals like Ctrl+C (SIGINT) and Ctrl+Z (SIGTSTP). You can use the signal() function to register signal handlers.


9. Handling input/output redirection: Detect and handle input/output redirection symbols ("<", ">", ">>") in the user input. For example, if the user enters "command > file.txt", you should redirect the command's output to the specified file.


10. Handling piping: Detect and handle pipe symbol ("|") in the user input. If the user enters "command1 | command2", you should connect the output of "command1" as the input of "command2".


11. Handling background processes: Implement the ability to run commands in the background by appending "&" at the end of the command. The shell should not wait for background processes to complete.


12. Exit command with arguments: Implement the ability to exit the shell when the user enters the "exit" command.


13. Memory management and cleanup: Make sure to free any dynamically allocated memory and handle any necessary cleanup before exiting the shell
